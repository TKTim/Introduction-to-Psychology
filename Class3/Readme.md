## The lesson of Sigmund Freud's Freudian theory


### 1. Our mind is constantly determined by the three basic thing in our head, "id", "ego" and "superego". All of them are fighting and against each other, and the winner decide what move do we do.

## The id(本我)
> According to Freud, is present at birth. It's the animal part of the self. It wants to eat, drink, pee, poop, get warm, and have sexual satisfaction. It is outrageously stupid.
## The ego(自我)
>This system is known as the ego, or the self. And it works on the "Reality Principle." And it works on the principle of trying to figure out how to make your way through the world, how to satisfy your pleasures or, in some cases, how to give up on them. And the ego – the emergence of the ego for Freud--symbolizes the origin of consciousness.
## The superego(超我)
> the superego is the internalized rules of parents in society. So, what happens in the course of development is, you're just trying to make your way through the world and satisfy your desires, but sometimes you're punished for them. Some desires are inappropriate, some actions are wrong, and you're punished for it. 


### 2. lot of **defense mechanisms** involve taking a desire and turning it. 

>Now, what **displacement(換置)** does is it takes it from you to her. I'm angry at you but maybe that's forbidden for some reason, so I'll be angry at her. 

 >What **projection(投影)** does is takes a desire from me and then puts it on somebody else heading outwards.
 
 > And what **sublimation(昇華)** does is it just gives up the details and keeps the energy. So, you stay up--Your roommate stays up all night working and you say to your roommate, for instance, "That's just because you haven't had sex in a long time and you want to have sex so you devote all your energy to your math exam."

### 3. falsifiability(可證偽性)
>The issue of vagueness is summarized in a more technical way by the philosopher Karl Popper who described--who introduced the term of **falsifiability**. The idea of falsifiability is that what distinguishes science from non science is that scientific predictions make strong claims about the world and these claims are of a sort that they could be proven wrong. If they couldn't be proven wrong, they're not interesting enough to be science. 
>> To explain it simply. If something is not right and not wrong in the same time, it means it can't be prove to be one or another, which makes it a not falsifiable thing. And not falsifiable thing can't be called as a science. For example: horoscope(星座運勢), astrology(占星術) 

### 4. Freud fails the test of falsifiability. because Freudian theory is often so vague and flexible that it can't really be tested in any reliable way. A big problem with this is a lot of Freudian theory is claimed to be validated in the course of psychoanalysis(精神分析).

>Here are some fun conversations. 
>>Freud says to a patient, "You hate your mother." The patient says, "Wow. That makes sense." Freud says, "I'm right." 
>>>Freud says, "You hate your mother," and the patient says, "No, I don't. That's disgusting." Freud says, "Your anger shows this idea is painful to you. You have repressed it from consciousness. I am right."

### 5. hazing is illegal but a remarkably successful tool. 
>The more you pay for something the more you like it and the more pain you go through to get something the more you like it. From the standpoint of politics for instance, if you want loyal people in a political campaign, do not pay them. If you pay them, they'll like you less. If they volunteer, they'll like you more.
