## ** Evolution, Emotion, and Reason: Emotions, Part I**

>Throughout the course, what seems natural to us and try to make sense of it. And to that end we have to ask questions that you wouldn't normally ask. like why we think poop smells bad, why I feel angry when someone hit me.

## 1. Why we smile

> Instead of we smile because we are happy, we smile because we are about to join a happy communication. There are some reserchs such like, the observation of bowling. bowling player doesn't smile when he hit a strike, rather they smile after they turn around and face to the audience.

## 2. "Pan Am" smile or Duchenne smile
>The one on the left is a smile of greeting. It's sometimes known as a "Pan Am" smile, which is a fake one.　Not many people can fake a Duchenne smile. And the big diffrent between these two is not in smile but the eyes.

### Fun fact : It is extremly difficult to not smile while someone is smiling in front of you. And this is also works on diffrent emotions.

## 3. The reason why animals tend to take care of their child
> Animals try to live or doing anything to keep themself alive is not only to survive. What matters then is not survival, per se. What matters is reproduction. And so, that simple fact is why we would expect __animals__ to care for their children, because children are the means through which genes replicate.

## 4. having cold (Virus thoughts)
> If you have a cold, try to get away from your own selfish perspective. Look at it from the perspective of the cold virus. The cold virus has evolved just as much as you evolved. And it's evolved due to survival and reproduction. 

### 弓形蟲 (Toxoplasma gondii)
>There's a parasite known as toxoplasmosis that lives in the bodies of rats. But it gets passed on when the rats get eaten by cats. And then it ends up in the cats' feces and then it ends up back in rats. If you are a rat and you have toxoplasmosis, you are perfectly healthy except for one thing. The toxoplasmosis rewires your brain and it makes you less afraid of cats. Now, again, this is not some sort of bizarre quirk of a humorous god. Rather, it's because this is a perfectly adaptive strategy of the toxoplasmosis virus.

 ### Other cases
 > There are almost all of the virus do things like the Toxoplasma we spoke before. For instance, "Rabies", "syphilis", etc.

 ## 5. An animal's merely the gene's way of making another gene.

 ## 6. Harlow's Studies on Dependency in Monkeys
 > In this research, there are two parts. the psychologist Harlow performed a series of ingenious experiments with nonhuman primates distinguishing between what he called "wire mothers" and "cloth mothers." And you'll see illustrations of this to follow. Wire mothers are mothers that are built that they give food. They have a little nipple attached and you can drink from it and give food to the baby. And that's the baby's source of food. Cloth mothers don't give any food but they give warmth and comfort.

 ### First, Monster coming.
 >In the first experiment, there is a scary monster coming in to the cage. The result is little monkey tends to go for cloth mother for help. 
 ### Second, new enviroment
 >First. Now without monkey's mothers, it is sent to a new room which full of new stuffs. As soon as it comes in that room, he goes to find comfort which is a soft blanket just like the "cloth mother".

 >Second. They put "Wire mother" in the new room, but the result is same as the first test.

 >Third. They put "Wire mother" in the new room, monkey goes to the "Wire mother".

 >Fourth and so on, little monkey seems to be familiar with this room right now. it starts to explore diffrent things in that room.

## Professor Paul Bloom : I want to begin next class by wrapping up and explaining the Harlow studies in more detail and what they tell us. And then we'll move towards altruism, towards non kin. I'll see you next week.
