### Overview:
>This lecture explores issues and ideas related to the branch of psychology known as cognitive development. It begins with an introduction of "Piaget" who, interested in the emergence of knowledge in general, studied children and the way they learn about the world in order to formulate his theories of cognitive development. This is followed by an introduction to the modern science of infant cognition. Finally, the question of the relationship between and the existence of different kinds of development is addressed.

### 1.　Object permanence 

>Which babies don't have.
>>Object permanence is the understanding that things exist when you no longer see them.If I just go under the table while you seeing me doing it. Your Object permanence will let you believe that I am still under the table even you don't see me at the time.

### 2.　egocentrism
>egocentrism has a meaning in common English which means to be selfish.But _Piaget_ meant it in a more technical way. He claimed that children at this age literally **can't understand that others can see the world differently from them.** 
#### Experiment:
> one of his demonstrations was the three mountains task. We have three mountains over there. You put a child on one side of the mountains and you ask him to draw it, and a four- or five-year-old can do it easily, but then you ask him to draw it as it would appear from the other side and children find this extraordinarily difficult. They find it very difficult to grasp the world as another person might see it.

### 3.　Conservation

> If you take a bunch of pennies and you spread them out, you don't get more pennies. But kids, according to Piaget, don't know that.

### 4.　 limitations in Piaget's theory

>Piaget was really big into question and answer, but one problem with this is that children aren't very good with language, and this might lead you to underestimate how much they know. And this is particularly a problem the younger you get.

### 5.　How early do babies know the difference of good or bad

>Here is the experiment by Kiley Hamlin ---> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki1zyu81iMg)

>So, this suggests that some social understanding may be there from the very start. This evidence is tentative, very controversial.

### 6.　Autism

>**autism** is is a disorder that strikes about one in a thousand people, mostly boys. And the dominant problems consist of a lack of social connectedness, problems with language, problems dealing with people, and more generally. 

>A problem of what the psychologist, Simon Baron-Cohen has described as "mind blindness." In that autistic people show no impairments dealing with the physical world, they show no impairments on--they don't necessarily show any impairments on mathematical skills or spatial skills, but they have a lot of problems with people.

#### "the false-belief task" experiment:
> There's a doll named Maxie and Maxie puts the ball in the cupboard. Maxie leaves and a second doll enters. The second doll takes the ball out of the cupboard and puts it under the bed. Maxie comes back and the question is, "Where will Maxie look for the ball?" 

#### Diffrent answers:
>Now, this is a question about your understanding about minds. **The question of where is the ball really is a question about the physical world.** Everyone can solve it, but this question is hard. The right answer is Maxie will look in the cupboard, even though it's not really there because Maxie has a false belief about the world. Three-year-olds find this difficult. Two-year-olds find this difficult. Four-year-olds and five-year-olds are able to pass this task. Normal adults are able to pass this task. Children with autism have serious problems. And often, people with autism who are otherwise very high functioning will fail this task. They'll say, "He's going to check under the bed."

### 7.　modules 
> If you believe in modules, there are often two modules. _physics and people. An object module and a social module._ 
---
### 8. 　Why, developmental psychology?
>Here is a great example from **Stephen Jay Gould**.

>He asked the question "Is a zebra a black animal with white stripes or a white animal with black stripes?" Now, you could look at adult zebras all day long and you're never going to figure this out. But if you want to know the answer, and I knew it, but I forget what it is--It doesn't matter. But if you wanted to know it you could. You would look at development and you'd watch the embryological development of a zebra and that's how you would learn the answer to your question.

### Final

>This is by the famous biologist, **D'Arcy Thompson**, who wrote the book On Growth and Form, and it's sort of the model of many developmental psychologists and many evolutionary psychologists so I'll end with this: "Everything is the way it is because it got that way."
