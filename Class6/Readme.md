## **How Do We Communicate?: Language in the Brain, Mouth and the Hands**

### 1.　Darwin suggests that language comes natural to human

>every human society has language. In the course of traveling, cultures encounter other cultures and they often encounter cultures that are very different from their own. But through the course of human history, nobody has ever encountered another group of humans that did not have a language. 

#### "pidgin"

>Someone who were enslaved from different cultures would develop a makeshift communication system so they could talk to one another. And this is called a "pidgin". pidgin was not a language. It was strings of words borrowed from the different languages around them and put together in sort of haphazard ways.

### 2. 　To suppourt Darwin's theory [1]
> There's a wonderful case in Nicaragua in sign language where they acquire sign language from adults who themselves are not versed in sign language. They're sort of second-language learners struggling along. What you might have expected would be the children would then use whatever system their adults use, but they don't. They "creolized" it. They take this makeshift communication system developed by adults and, again, they turn it into a full-blown language, suggesting that to some extent _it's part of our human nature to create languages._

### 3.　Phonology 語音學 Boundaries between the words
>you're listening to me speak and in between each of my words you're hearing a **pause**. You don't have to be very smart to figure out where one word begins and one word ends. But the pause is a _psychological illusion_. If you were to just talk into an oscilloscope that measured your sound vibrations, there are no pauses between the words. Rather, the pauses are inserted by your mind as you already know where one word begins and another one ends. And you insert a pause at that point.

### 4.  　"top-down" processing
>Top-down processing is an example of when you know what something is, you hear it that way. 
---
### 5.　Morphology 構詞學
>**Morphology** is the next level up. **Phonology** is sounds. Morphology is words. And human language uses this amazing trick described by Ferdinand de Saussure, the great linguist, as **"the arbitrariness of the sign."** And what this means is we can take any arbitrary(任意的) idea in the world, the idea of a chair or a story or a country, and make a sound or a sign to connect to it. 

#### Example, "Dogs"
> You don't have to kone the word "Dogs". You just need to know "Dog" and the plural morpheme 's'.
---
### 6.　Syntax(語法) = grammar

>So, we have the sound system of a language, the **phonology**. We have the words of a language, the **morphology**, but all that gives you is "dog," "cup," "chair," "house," "story," "idea." That won't allow us to communicate complicated ideas.

### 7.　Noam Chomsky's declaim
>the guy who we met when we talked about behaviorism who wrote A Review of Verbal Behavior, the linguist Noam Chomsky. And Chomsky makes this radical claim. And this is that we shouldn't view language learning as learning at all. Instead, we should view it as something similar to **growth**.
---
### 8. 　genetic disorders to language
 >Some impairments of language could be due to trauma, the aphasias. Trauma, a blow to the head, a stroke can rid you of your language. But, also, there are **genetic disorders**, some falling under the rubric of what's known as "specific language impairment," where children are born without the same ability as the rest of us to learn to speak. And these are interesting in many ways.
---
 ### 9. 　baby learn language
 >Around twelve months of age, children start using their first words. These are words for objects and actions like "dog" and "up" and "milk." They start showing some sensitivity to the order of words. So they know that "dog bites cat" is different from "cat bites dog." Around eighteen months of age, they start learning words faster. They start producing little, miniature sentences like "Want cookie" or "Milk spill" and the function morphemes, the little words, "in," "of," "a," "the," and so on start to gradually appear.

### 10.　Brain's ability to llanguage
>If you start learning a language – a second language is where most of the work's been done – within the first few years of life you're fine. You'll speak like a native. But then it starts getting worse and worse. And once you hit puberty, suddenly there's huge variation in the abilities you have to learn language.

> It is very rare, for instance, for somebody who has learned English past puberty to speak without an accent. An accent is very hard to shake and it's not just an accent. It's also other aspects of phonology, syntax, and morphology. It's like the part of the brain that's responsible for language learning is only around early in development and if you don't get your language by then it'll just run out.

---
 >It turns out the developmental milestones of sign languages and the developmental milestones of spoken languages are precisely the same.
