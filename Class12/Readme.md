## 2. Use the fact that we don't take for granted as a way to motivate the scientific study of things we do take for granted.

>One of professor's friend studies why people hold religious beliefs. And he tells me that when he's talking to a non specialist, he doesn't ever tell them, <ins>"Yeah, I'm really interested in why people believe in the Bible or  why people go to church"</ins> because these are religions that people around here hold, and if you tell people you study them they'll sort of be **puzzled**, "why would you want to study something like that" or **offended**. If you want to talk about the psychology of religion to an audience like this, what you do is you start with the exotic. 

>So, you start by talking about a culture that believes in spirits or that trees can talk. You say you're studying it and they say, <ins>"Oh, that's interesting. I wonder why they believe that?"</ins> And you use that as a way to look at more general facts that exist even in our culture. You use the fact that we don't take the exotic for granted as a way to motivate the scientific study of things we do take for granted.

## 6. Using prisoner's dilemma to show the important of comunication and trust
