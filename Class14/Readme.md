## What Motivates Us: Sex

James Gleick:
>Americans tell pollsters their single favorite activity is sex. These same studies suggested the average time per day devoted to sex is four minutes and three seconds.

So it's really not that long, but somehow human's history, controversy and creative pursuits are related to it.

### biology、Gene

The first one is by Steve Pinker in How the Mind Works. And he writes,

>Nature does not dictate what we should accept or how we should live our lives. Well into my procreating years, I am so far voluntarily childless, having squandered my biological resources reading and writing, doing research, helping friends and students, and jogging in circles--ignoring the solemn imperative to spread my genes. By Darwinian standards, I am a horrible mistake, a pathetic loser, but I am happy to be that way, and if my genes don't like it they can go jump in the lake.

Richard Dawkins writes,

>If a child has had bad teaching in mathematics, it is accepted that a resulting deficiency can be remedied by extra-good teaching in the following year. But any suggestion that the child's deficiency might have a genetic origin is likely to be greeted with something approaching despair. If it's in the genes, it is determined and nothing can be done about it. This is pernicious nonsense on an almost astrological scale. Genetic causes and environmental causes are in principle no different from each other. Some may be harder to reverse, others may be easy. What did genes do to deserve their sinister, juggernaut-like reputation? Why are genes thought to be so much more fixed and inescapable in their effects than television, nuns or books.

BUT!! Here is a opsite example. My eyesight is quite poor. The reason why my eyesight is quite poor is not due to the patriarchy, television or culture. Rather, my eyesight is quite poor due to the crappy genes Mom and Dad gave me. It is **genetically** determined if anything is. It is also fairly easy to fix. There are these machines where they put panes of glass in front of your eyes and help you to see better, which is called glasses.

So this is odd, something genetically determined can be fix but some of them can't.


### About Gay

So here is a conclusion. 

1. Human can not chooose their own Sexual orientation.
2. There is a big question. Despite the techlology progress, Why gay gene haven't disappear in times.
