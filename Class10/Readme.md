## **Evolution, Emotion, and Reason: Evolution and Rationality**

## 1. Apply evolutionary theory to psychology
>There are two ways you can go **seriously wrong** here.

1. >We're taking an evolutionary approach then natural selection will cause animals to want to spread their genes. So, if we're being biological about it, that means everybody must run around thinking "I want to spread my genes." What this fails to do is make a distinction between **ultimate causation** and **proximate causation**.
* **Ultimate causation** is the reason why something is there in the first place, over millions of years of history. 
*  **Proximate causation** is why you're doing it now.
2. adapataion or accident ? 
>that occupy our interest or our fascination in day-to-day life are almost certainly **evolutionary accidents**. Why do you like chocolate bars, assuming that you do? It is not because your ancestors in the African savanna who enjoyed chocolate bars reproduced more than those who didn't. Rather, it is because we've evolved a taste for sweet things.

## 2. Controversy in psychology over the scope of evolutionary explanations (在心理學中以演化論來解釋)
>There's a lot of controversy in psychology over the scope of evolutionary explanations. And a lot of the debate tends to be over **what's an adaptation and what isn't**. There are some clear cases. We have color vision. Why do we have color vision? Well, I think everybody would agree we have color vision as an adaptation because of the advantages it gives us for seeing and making visual distinctions. We are afraid of snakes. We're going to talk about that in more detail but there's a straightforward adaptive story about that. We are afraid of snakes because, really, our ancestors who weren't afraid of snakes didn't reproduce as much as those that were. We like chocolate bars and we enjoy NASCAR. Those cannot be adaptations because chocolate bars and NASCAR are recent developments that could not have been anticipated by evolution.

## 3. Debate on pregnancy 
>pregnancy sickness has traditionally been viewed as just a breakdown in the system, everything's askew. **Margie Profet** suggested an alternative and this won her the **[MacArthur Genius Award.]** 
1. >It suggests the timing of onset and offset of pregnancy sickness, of morning sickness, should correspond to the period of maximal vulnerability on the part of the developing embryo(胚胎期) or fetus(胎兒). Suggested the types of foods avoided should correspond to those sorts of foods that were most **deadly for the fetus** and that were deadly for the fetus during the periods where humans evolved.
2. >This last qualification is an important one. Women do not develop an aversion(厭惡) to alcohol during pregnancy even though alcohol is extremely dangerous to the developing child. The answer is an easy one. Alcohol wasn't around during our evolutionary history and we could not have evolved a system to protect ourselves from it.

## 4. One of the reason to put evolutionary in psychology
> In Class 9 we learn about love and sex, and there are "Big three" to show what kind of people you would most likely find him or her sexy. "proximity", "Similarity" and "Familiarity", but that is not always right. In one circumstance, Sibiling is close to us, genetically like us and live with us for more than 10 years. It is quite a special case, but if you see this in a evolutional way, it's quite easy. The people which perform incest are harder to survive than people who don't. 

## 5. About incest
>You avoid sex with people you grew up with. Yes, that does diminish sexual desire, but an even bigger cue was "did you observe your parents, and in particular, your mother, taking care of that person?" If you did, that seriously diminishes sexual desire and brings it down to the level of disgust.

## 6. Framing effect
>I show you something like a chocolate bar and I say, "How much will you give me for this chocolate bar? It looks like you're pretty hungry. How much will you give me for this chocolate bar?" And you say, "I'll give you **two dollars** for this chocolate bar."

> The other condition's exactly the same except I hand you a chocolate bar and say, "How much money will you **[sell me]** that chocolate bar for?" There, people say, "Two fifty," and in fact, what happens is once you own something its value shoots up. And this has mystified economists and psychologists. It makes no sense. The chocolate bar doesn't even have to move. I just leave it on the table and say either "How much will you spend," "How much will you give me for this?" or "Okay. It's yours. How much do you want for me to take it back?" The answer is, it's framing. **[If you're asking how much you want for it, it's a gain.]** It's just how much will you pay to get something. But if you're being asked how much do you want for me to take it from you, **[you treat it as a loss.]** And as a loss it becomes more valuable. Those are framing effects.

## 7. Base rates
>There's a disease that hits one in a thousand people.  There's a test for the disease and if you have it, it's going to tell you you have it. On the other hand, it's not perfect. It has a false positive rate of five percent. **Now, it say you have it.**

Question
>how likely do you think the odds are you have the disease?

Answer
>two percent. One percent of a thousand will have the disease. That person will test positive. The test never misses. That leaves nine hundred ninety-nine people who don't have the disease, and we'll say about fifty percent of these people have it. So, for every fifty-one people who test positive, only one will have the disease, giving an average of about two percent. 

>People tends to ignore the base rates.

## 8. Avalibility bias
>People sometimes get something wrong because they don't think of it in daily time. Like this, do you know food-poisoning is more deathful than shock attack.

## 9. Confirmation bias
### Experiment: Wason selection task
>I suggest you to see the websites.
