## The lesson of unconscious,Behaviorism  & Reinforcement

### Burrhus Frederic Skinner
>He was an American psychologist, behaviorist.


### 1.　dog, saliva and bell
> The experiment is about feeding dogs to generate saliva, but in the same time, you ring the bell.  
> 　You train the dog to undserstand that the food comes with the bell ring.  
>　After few training, when you shows up only with the bell, the dog will generate saliva.  
>　* When you stop training, it will stop generate saliva when it see or hear the ring.

### 2.　un/conditioned stimulus,un/conditioned response
>An unconditioned is when an unconditioned stimulus gives rise to an unconditioned response, and so is conditioned.

### Experiment:
>Little Albert was playing with the rat, "Oh, I like rats, oh," Watson went behind the baby and banged the metal bar right here .   
>The baby, "Aah," screamed, started to sob. Okay. What's the **unconditioned stimulus**? Somebody. The loud noise, the bar, the bang. What's the **unconditioned response**? Crying, sadness, misery. And as a result of this, Little Albert grew afraid of the rat. So there--what would be the **conditioned stimulus**? The rat. What would be the **conditioned response**? Fear. Excellent.

unconditioned stimulus (無意識刺激)
>The loud noise

unconditioned response (無意識反應)
>Crying, sadness, misery

conditioned stimulus 
>The rat

conditioned response
>Fear

### 3.　Reinforcement
>Reinforcement is something that makes the behavior increase.   
>Negative reinforcement is very different from punishment.  
>**Negative reinforcement** is just a type of reward. The difference is in **positive reinforcement** you do something; in negative reinforcement you take away something aversive.

### 4.　shaping
>You've got to work your way to make something do what you want. And the act of working your way to it is known as **shaping**.  

### pig dancing experiment:
>　So, here is how to get a pig to dance. You wait for the pig to do something that's halfway close to dancing, like stumbling, and you reward it.   
Then it does something else that's even closer to dancing and you reward it. And you keep rewarding it as it gets closer to closer. 

### tell your kid to get you a bear experiment:

>Here's how to get your child to bring you some beer.  
 You say, "Johnny, could you go to the kitchen and get me some beer?" And he walks to the kitchen and then he forgets why he's there and you run out there. "You're such a good kid. Congratulations. Hugs." And then you get him to--and then finally you get him to also open up the refrigerator and get the beer, open the door, get the--and in that way you can train creatures to do complicated things.

### Train by two steps including (conditioned and shaping)
> Saying "good dog" to a dog doesn;t make sence in dog's mind. We have to treat the dog and saying "good dog" as a reward. In this way, it can unserstand and see the prase "good dog" as a reward. We can say it's a Two-steps training.

### 5.　Ratio(比率) and interval(間隔)
>The difference between ratio is a reward every certain number of times somebody does something.   
>So, if every tenth time your dog brought you the newspaper you gave it hugs and treats; that's ratio.   
>An interval is over a period of time. So, if your dog gives you--if your dog, I don't know, dances for an hour straight, that would be an interval thing. And fixed versus variable speaks to whether you give a reward on a fixed schedule, every fifth time, or variable, sometimes on the third time, sometimes on the seventh time, and so on.

ex.

> a **slot machine** is variable ratio. It goes off after it's been hit a certain number of times. It doesn't matter how long it takes you for--to do it. It's the number of times you pull it down. But it's variable because it doesn't always go off on the thousandth time. You don't know. It's unpredictable. 

### 6.　Garcia effect
>Sometimes called, (Conditioned taste aversion).
Often food aversions(厭惡) in humans and other animals can be formed through a form of association. What happens is suppose you have the flu and you get very nauseous and then at the same point you eat some sashimi for the first time. The connection between being nauseous and eating a new food is very potent.   
**Important:**  
　　　The Garcia effect is that this is special to taste and nausea. It doesn't extend more generally.

my thought:
>I think you can see Garcia effect as a reason why kids don't like vegetable or medicine, something is bitter. Because when humans were young, they were more sensitive to taste,Which makes things taste stronger than it original is.  
In this case, kids tend to dislike it more, but when he/she gets older, the problem solve. They can taste it well and get rid of their childhood feeling about the food they hate if they try.

### 7.　Chomsky's "Review of Verbal Behavior."
> It says that when it comes to humans, the notions of reward and punishment and so on that Skinner tried to extend to humans are so vague it's not science anymore.

### 8.　Clonclusion 
>**behaviorism** as a dominant intellectual field has faded, but it still leaves behind an important legacy and it still stands as one of the major contributions of twentieth century psychology.
