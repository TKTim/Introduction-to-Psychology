## **Evolution, Emotion, and Reason: Love (Guest Lecture by Professor Peter Salovey)**

## 1. three components of love
>**Robert Sternberg**, who is now the dean at Tufts University but was here on our faculty at Yale for nearly thirty years or so. And he has a theory of love that argues that it's made up of three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment.

## 2.　The big three
>The big three are three variables that the effects are so powerful that they almost don't need to be discussed in much detail. The more interesting four are the ones I'm going to focus on in this lecture because they're a bit more subtle and they may be things that you've never heard of before. But let's quickly talk about the big three.The way to understand the big three is with the phrase "all other things being equal."

### 1. close spatial proximity to each other
>_All other things being equal_, people who find themselves in close spatial proximity to each other, like sharing an armrest in a lecture, will be more likely to be attracted to each other and form a romantic relationship. 

### 2. Similarity
>When people are more similar they are more likely to find each other attractive. This could be obvious things like height or age but it also could be things like attitudes toward capital punishment, preference for the Red Sox over the Yankees. Right? All of these are dimensions of similarity. _All things being equal_ , the more similar the more likely you'll find each other attractive. 

### 3. Familiarity
>We tend to fall in love with people in our environment with whom we are already familiar. 
>> By the way, the familiarity idea doesn't just work for people. I can show you words in a language that you don't speak and I can flash those words to you very quickly and I can later repeat some of those words and mix in some new ones that you've never seen before and I can say, "If you had to tell me, which ones do you like and which ones don't you like or how much do you like each one?" **The ones you will like are the ones you saw earlier**, the ones that you already have familiarity. Even if you don't remember having seen them, even if that familiarity was generated with such quick exposures that you don't remember even having seen anything, you will get that familiarity effect. 
### Conclusion
>So the big three: People who are similar to you, people who are already familiar to you, people who are nearby in space. These are the people, all things being equal, that you will find attractive.

## 3. competence (有能力的)
> Generally, we are more attracted to people who seem competent to us. Yes, we're more attracted to people who are competent than people who we think are incompetent but people who are super competent, people who seem competent on all dimensions, they're kind of threatening to us. They don't make us feel so good about ourselves. Right? They make us feel a bit diminished by comparison. So, the kind of person we're really attracted to is the competent individual who occasionally blunders(失誤). And this is called the **"Pratfall Effect(出醜效應)"**, that our liking for the competent person grows when they make a mistake, when they do something embarrassing,

## 4. Face, body matter
>We human always seem the way people look is not that important in a relationship. Well, it's not entirley right. Attraction of a person is quite important when we decide there is going to be a second date or not. But in a long term relationship it seems less important.

### fizzy wig experiment
>　the **confederate**(A hired actor in psychology terms) that they hired was a woman who was naturally attractive in most people's view but they made her look either more attractive or less attractive by giving her kind of frumpy clothes, bad make-up, and a frizzy wig. And it was the **frizzy wig** that everybody remembers from this experiment. And what she does in the experiment is she poses as a graduate student in clinical psychology who is interviewing male participants. And at the end of the interview she gives them **her own personal clinical evaluation** of their personality. Half of the subjects receive a favorable personality assessment. Half of them receive a kind of unfavorable evaluation.

#### result:
>when she was made to look attractive they were delighted when she gave them positive feedback about themselves. On the contrary, they feel sad when the feedback is negative.

>When she was made to look unattractive they didn't really care what kind of information she gave. It didn't really matter whether it was positive or not.

## 5.　Gain, loss
>What is very powerful to us is not just that someone always is positive toward us, "I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love --" Right? It wears out its welcome. What's more powerful is the person who was not that positive to us but over time becomes more positive. Aronson calls this the **"Gain Effect."** We are really attracted to people whose regard for us is gaining momentum over time. 

>What's interesting is there is also a loss effect. People who really hurt us are not the people who have always been negative. The person who every time they sees you hates you, says they hate you, after a while this person can't hurt you. Right? There's a country song that Ricky Skaggs sings that has the phrase in it **"Nothing can hurt you like the person you love."** That's what hurts, the person who always was positive, whose regard starts to fade. Oh. You can only hurt the one you love. Right? You can only hurt the one you love because you are expecting positive feedback from the one you love. And when that turns negative, it's a blow. _It's a blow to the solar plexus(太陽穴)[重重的打擊]_.

## 6.　misattribute arousal 錯誤歸因
>I can present you with a confederate. Let's say **you(the students in class)** are all in condition, everybody on this side of the room, and I can say to all of you, "Please wait here. We'll begin the experiment in a moment. While you're waiting please fill out this form." And the form includes **how attracted you are to the experimenter**, to me. I can do the same thing over here. I can give you the form and ask you to rate how attractive you think I am and I can give you the same instruction with a crucial difference: "Please wait here. We will begin the **"painful shock"** experiment in a moment. Please fill out these forms while you wait."

>What happens? The people who got the painful shock instruction are more likely to find the confederate attractive. Why? While they're sitting there thinking about painful shock it's making their heart beat faster, [sound of heartbeat] it's making their palms sweat, it's making them breathe harder maybe. And even though it's fairly obvious what's doing that, they still misattribute that arousal to "I must be falling in love," even with that obvious a--even with that obvious an instruction.

### Second Experiment
>Now, here's the final experiment.  In this experiment male subjects were brought in to the lab and they were asked to look at centerfolds from Playboy magazine. So, these are essentially photographs of naked women. And they are wearing headphones that amplify their heartbeat and they are asked among other things how attracted are they to the centerfold photograph that they're looking at.

>So, these slides are coming up. The slides are moving one after another for a few seconds each slide and they're listening to their heartbeat. [sound of heartbeat] Slide one. Slide two. Slide three. Slide four. **Slide five[which is harder]**. Slide six. And then they're asked which one did you find most attractive, which one are you most attracted to? "Oh, slide five, absolutely. She's the woman I want to marry." Right? And what has happened is they're using this bodily cue of their heartbeat to infer that that's who they find more attractive.

>Now, here is the twist. They're not actually listening to their heartbeat. They're listening to a tape recording of a heartbeat. And the experimenter is back there with the speed knob and at random intervals he just speeds up the tape of their heart and then slows it down. And it doesn't matter which slide he speeds up the tape of the heartbeat on, that's the one the subject is more likely to think is the person of their dreams. So even you can misattribute real arousal.
