## **Conscious of the Present; Conscious of the Past: Language ; Vision and Memory**

### 1.　baby can hear you in the womb
>There's been studies looking at newborn babies finding that pretty much the moment they pop out they favor their own language over other language--over other languages. And this suggests that they are listening while in utero, while in the womb, to the rhythms of their language and developing a preference for it.

### 2.　A series of claims of this course
>For **perception**, I want to first persuade you the problem of perception's hard and that successful perception involves educated and unconscious guesses about the world. 

>For **attention**, I want to suggest that we attend to some things and not others and we miss a surprising amount of what happens in the world. 

>For **memory**, there are many types of memory. The key to memory is organization and understanding. And you can't trust some of your memories.

### 3.　unconscious assumptions
> You have eyes. You have to figure out how to get from the numbers to objects and people, and to actions and events. And that's the problem. It's made particularly a difficult problem because the **retina is a two-dimensional surface and you have to infer a 3D world from a two-dimensional surface.** And this is, from a mathematical point of view, impossible. And what this means is that there--For any two-dimensional image there is an **indefinite number of three-dimensional images that correspond to it.**

> **The way we solve this problem** is that we have **"unconscious assumptions"** about how the world works. Our minds contain certain assumptions about how things should be that enable us to make educated guesses from the two-dimensional array on to the three-dimensional world.

### 4.　Shepard tables Experiment 
>It was developed by Roger Shepard. They are called Shepard tables. 　　[Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EqGqEpOV3o)

### 5.　About memory
>There's a distinction between semantic memory and episodic memory. **Semantic memory** is basically facts, what a word means, what's the capital of Canada, and so on.

> **Episodic** is autobiography, is what happened to you. That Yale is in New Haven is semantic. That you went on vacation away from New Haven last week, it would be episodic. 

>There is encoding stores and retrieval, which refers to different levels of what happens in memory. Encoding is getting the memory in, as when you study for a test or you have an experience. And **storage** is holding the memory. And **retrieval** is getting the memory out.

### 6.　How to access memory?
>Not everything gets in memory. You'd go mad if you tried to remember everything. You can't. So, what determines what gets into memory? Well, one answer is "**attention does**."

### 7.　Some attention experiment
