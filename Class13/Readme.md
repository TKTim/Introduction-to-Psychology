## 2. Defining and Measuring Intelligence

> There is “G” and there is “S.” “S” is your ability on specific tests. So, if there is ten tests that you’re given as part of an IQ test, ten subtests, you’ll get a different score on each of the subtests. There’ll be a math test and a reading test and a spatial test and you’ll get different scores. “G” refers to a general intelligence. And the general intelligence is something you bring to each of the tests in common. So, this is diagrammed here. You have these six tests. For each of them there is an “S” and then above that there is a “G.”
