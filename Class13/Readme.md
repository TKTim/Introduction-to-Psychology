## **Why Are People Different?: Differences**

## 1. "The Big Five" personality factors

#### 1-1 "neurotic versus stable." 
>Is somebody sort of nutty and worrying or are they calm?

#### 1-2 "Extrovert versus introvert."

#### 1-3 "Open to experience versus closed to experience."

#### 1-4 "Agreeable" 
>which is courteous, friendly versus non agreeable, rude, selfish.

#### 1-5 "conscientious versus not conscientious"
>careful versus careless, reliable versus undependable. 

>A good way to think about these things is in terms of the word "ocean," o-c-e-a-n. The first letter captures openness(開放), conscientiousness(盡責), extroversion(外向性), agreeableness(宜人性), and neuroticism(神經質). And the claim is those are the four--the five fundamental ways in which people differ from one another. <ins>Most of the people doing this test's result will not change after their 30.</ins>
