## **Conscious of the Present; Conscious of the Past: Vision and Memory (cont.)**

### 1.　Long-term memory
> long-term memory or "LTM" has a huge storage capacity. This is your memory like the hard drive of your computer. This is the memory you walk around with. It includes all the words in English, just for example, 60 to 80,000 words. It includes everybody you've ever met, languages, faces, stories, locations, nursery rhymes, songs, TV programs. Nobody knows the storage. It is not true that you remember everything that has ever happened to you. There's no reason to believe that this is true. At the same time though, you have a huge amount stored in your brain in long-term storage and nobody actually--It has to be limited because it's a finite, limited brain. But nobody knows how big it is. Nobody knows how many terabytes you carry around in your brain and--but it's a lot.

### 2. 　Short-term memory
>  the short-term memory, which is actually very limited. Your memory of what you could store on--in--where you could hold in consciousness right now is quite limited. Here is an exercise. _[Professor said 11 diffrent numbers and told students to write them down after he finished.]_
Surprisingly, under normal circumstances the cognitive psychologist **George Miller** said that this sort of suggested that the standard memory storage of short-term memory is seven, plus or minus two. 
---
### 3. 　chunks
>this raises the question "seven plus or minus two" what? And the answer seems to be what George Miller calls "chunks."

>How much you know depends on how much you store in memory because it affects what counts as a basic unit of memory. If you understand something before, like you learn it or have some sort of experience. Your chunks can be more. This shows up in expertise effect.

### 4. 　Experiment of the better way to remember
>they told people that there's going to be words flashed on a screen. And all of the subjects saw the same strings of words. There were forty-eight words. They were not told to memorize the words. One third of the subjects was told.

1. **Look**　　 "Look. Some of these words are going to come out in **capital letters**, some of them not capital letters. Press a button for capitals, non-capitals."

2. **Sound**　　The other group was told, "Some of these words will **rhyme with 'train,'** Others won't. Press a button if it rhymes in 'train'."

3. **Meaning.** 　　The third group was told, "Does it fit into the sentence ‘The girl placed the **blank** on the table'? Press a button if it does. Press a button if it doesn't." 

>Then they were asked as a surprise, **"What words did you see?**" And the findings looked like this. 

>When they were asked to focus on just what the word looked like, memory was very poor.
the sound better, the meaning better. If you want to remember something, the best way to remember it is to give it meaning, to **give it sense**.

### 5. 　Retrieval cues
>Retrieval cues are just things that have been associated with what you--what you're trying to remember. If I have to remember to replace the windows, when I walk in to my living room and see that a window is cracked that will remind me to replace the windows.
---
### 6. 　compatibility principle
>this means is you're much better to remember something in the context in which you have learned it. And this is also known as "context-dependent memory" and "state-dependent memory." 

#### Experiment
> It's illustrated by one of the strangest experiments in the history of psychology where they had people on a boat and then they had them scuba dive underwater. And they taught them things either on the boat or underwater with things that they held up. And then they tested them later. And it turns out that you'll remember it better if you're tested on it in the context in which you learned it. And it might be because then the retrieval cues help bring it back. But it's more general than that. If you have to remember something you learned in this class, you will do better if you try to think about the room in which you learned it in. You will do better on your final exam if you were to take it in this room than if you were to take it in another room because being in this room will bring back the cues.
---
### 7. 　People learn better when they are stoned
>People who learn things when they're stoned remember them better--keeping stoned at a sort of a low-level that doesn't disrupt other mental activities--remember them better when they're sort of stoned again than if they're non-stoned.
---
### 8. 　Elaborative rehearsal (精細複述)
>"Elaborative rehearsal" and retrieval involves the connections between different things. Elaborative rehearsal is that the more you think about something the easier it is to remember. If you have to think about--If you have to remember something, try to connect it to as many things as possible. Think of an image. Make a joke out of it. Imagine how you would explain it to somebody else.
---
```
Again, it's not true that you never forget. There is honest to God forgetting but sometimes you think you forget and it's because you haven't looked long enough. There's a real physical notion of searching for the right answer.
```

### 9. 　One of the theory of déjà vu
>The answer is it has happened before. It's happened** half a second ago**. And so what happens is sometimes there is a glitch, a disturbance in the force. There's a glitch and you are talking and then something happens to you and you put it in your memory. But it's as if you don't put the stamp on it of **what time and what date.** So, you're talking to me and then you store it in memory but you don't store it in memory as happening right now. Then half a second goes by and you're talking to me and you say, "This is strangely familiar." And that's one theory of what goes on in déjà vu.

### 10.　how people's memories can be swayed by leading questions.
>the best research on this has been done by Elizabeth Loftus who has done a series of studies.

#### First Experimeny
>In one experiment, the person was just asked in the course of a series of questions--shown a scene where there's a car accident and asked either, "Did you see a broken headlight?" or "Did you see the broken headlight?" The ‘the' presupposes that there was a broken headlight and in fact, the people told--asked, "Did you see the broken headlight?" later on are more likely to remember one. It creates an image and they fill it in.

#### Second Experimeny
>she would show film segments and then ask, "Did you see the children getting on the school bus?" Now, there was no school bus but people who hear that question later on when asked, "Did you see a school bus in the film?" are more likely to say yes. 
#### Third Experimeny
>In another study, she would show people film segments and ask them either, "How fast were the cars going when they **"hit"** each other?" or "How fast were the cars going when they **"smashed"** into each other?" A week later she'd bring people back in to the laboratory and ask, "Did you see any broken glass?" Those who hear a smash tend to see the broken glass more than those who hear a hit because the question has changed their memory, making it more of a dramatic event.
---
### 11. 　Hypnosis 
>What hypnotizing does is it makes people very willing to cooperate. Unfortunately, it **isn't** as if there is a memory storage there where you could just go through and look as in the movies where you just say, "What's the license plate?" The person's hypnotized and then the flashback comes in and then they zoom in on the license plate.

> Memory doesn't work that way. What happens is--What somebody will do in a hypnotizable state is they'll be very eager to please the hypnotist. And so they'll make stuff up.
---
### 12.　Debate on hypnotic techniques
>there's a subset of cases where people have had no memory up to a point of what happened to them. Then they go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist; they undergo questioning, often using hypnotic techniques; and then they recover a memory of past traumatic **sexual abuse**. 
#### People who believe
>And what makes this so debatable, I don't want to try to preclude it one way or another. What makes this debatable is some psychologists believe that, in at least some cases, these memories are real and they have been repressed through a Freudian mechanism – that they're too terrible to bring to consciousness, and the therapy brings them out into real life. 
#### People who does not believe
>But most psychologists believe that these memories cannot be trusted, that these memories are created through the actions of the therapist.
#### Conclusion
>Similarly, people _who have been accused of sexual abuse have pressed criminal_ charges against psychiatrists claiming that these psychiatrists have implanted the memories into their sons and daughters. 

>It is controversial whether memories are ever repressed. **What isn't controversial is that, for at least some cases, you can implant false memories in people**, not because you're a sinister or evil person but because you really believed something happened. And you talked to them about it and then you caused these memories to come into being.
